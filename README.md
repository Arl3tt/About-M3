# Hi, I‚Äôm Vanessa Diaz üëã

I‚Äôm a **Neuroscience graduate, BCI Developer, and AI Software Engineer** passionate about building technologies that **bridge the brain, behavior, and AI**. I love creating **NeuroAI and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems** that help people enhance cognition, improve therapy, and interact with technology in smarter ways.  

I spend my days designing **real-time EEG pipelines, neurofeedback applications, and emotion-aware systems** using **Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, embedded devices, and cloud platforms**. I enjoy taking **research ideas and turning them into user-centered, practical neurotechnologies** that have a real-world impact.
