- Hi there, I'm Arl3tt! ðŸ‘‹
- Iâ€™m passionate about AI, machine learning, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and Iâ€™m currently working on integrating these technologies into creative solutions for finance, healthcare, and personal enhancement.

ðŸš€ My Projects
Iâ€™m working on:

Building deep reinforcement learning trading strategies to optimize stock market trading.
Developing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications that enhance cognitive abilities, neuroplasticity, and motor control.
Creating BCI-based cognitive training tools using TensorFlow and OpenBCI hardware.
ðŸ§  My Skills
Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Experienced with TensorFlow, Keras, and TensorFlow Lite.
Reinforcement Learning: Exploring algorithms for trading and real-time decision-making.
Brain-Computer Interfaces: Implementing Motor Imagery, P300, and Neurofeedback techniques for healthcare applications.
App Development: Building integrations with GitHub Apps, Probot, and custom bots to enhance workflow automation.
Hardware Integration: Using OpenBCI EEG systems and other sensors to connect with software tools.
ðŸ“š Recent Learning
Iâ€™ve recently completed several TensorFlow-focused courses from Deeplearning AI, including:

Data Pipelines with TensorFlow Data Services
Advanced Deployment Scenarios with TensorFlow
Device-based Models with TensorFlow Lite
ðŸŒ± Currently Learning
Exploring more about Neurofeedback and its applications in cognitive enhancement.
Diving deeper into real-time data processing for BCI applications.
Investigating how to combine AI with affordable hardware for cutting-edge BCI solutions.
ðŸ¤– Fun Fact
Iâ€™m building my own AI-powered robot to automate trading strategies and make cognitive feedback interactive!
